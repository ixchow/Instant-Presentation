A quick hack to auto-generate slides. Depends on cURL, wget, sox, and a recent imagemagick.

Released into the public domain.


Usage:
./record.pl -- uses sox to record snippets of audio, which it moves to 'words.flac'
./recognize.pl -- grabs any 'words.flac' and sends to google's speech-to-text API; writes 'utterance'
./slidify.pl -- grabs any 'utterance' and uses google image search + some imagemagick to make a slide (slide.png)

For my SIGBOVIK talk, I used a custom C++/SDL program to actually show 'slide.png'; this program is not included. However, pointing gqview (a nice image viewer) at slide.png seems to work equally well.
